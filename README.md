# forum-vue-school

## Description

This is a Vue School Practice project, it is very complete and is focused on being as realistic as possible when it comes to developing a deployable application, it contains all the important parts when developing, structuring the data, making use of fast and compatible plugins, cleaning errors, making use of tools such as Vuex, Vue Router or Firebase for the Backend, and applying the best practices of Vue 3.

## Uso
Is a simple but quite complete forum that can be used to create a mini-community that wants its own internal communication network, for more private discussions or to organize events.


## Roadmap

  In the future I plan to refactor it with typescript as a practical use and make some substantial improvements to make it look more presentable.
